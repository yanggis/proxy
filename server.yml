# PKI defines the location of credentials for this node. Each of these can also be inlined by using the yaml ": |" syntax.

# The syntax is:
#   "{nebula ip}": ["{routable ip/dns name}:{routable port}"]
# Example, if your lighthouse has the nebula IP of 192.168.200.1 and has the real ip address of 100.64.22.11 and runs on port 4242:

  "192.168.200.1": ["100.64.22.11:4242"]

  # delegated to for resolution

  # interval is the number of seconds between updates from this node to a lighthouse.
  # during updates, a node sends information about its current IP addresses to each node.
